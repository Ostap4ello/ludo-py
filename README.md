### LUDO - Človeče nehnevaj sa ###
by Ostap Pelekh, 1bc., API7

Program simulates The LUDO game.
It begins with two prompts that ask you about size of board and number of players.
After that it shows step-by-step simulation of game.
# !!! Please, read the prompts shown in the game !!! #

# Differences:
1. Next figure of player goes on board only after previous finishes (so each player have max. 1 figure on the board)
2. When two players are on the same field, they are displayed, as both of letters (for example, when 'A' meets 'B', they are shown as 'AB')
=> Rules with 'blocking the field' and 'meeting on one field' are not implemented
