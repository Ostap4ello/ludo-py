# LUDO - Človeče nehnevaj sa
by Ostap Pelekh, 1bc., API7

### Program simulates The LUDO game.
It begins with two prompts requiring you to enter board size and number of players.
After that the game is simulated step-by-step.

## Differences from the original game:
1. Next figure of player goes on board only after previous finishes (so each player have max. 1 figure on the board).
2. When two or more players are on the same field, they are displayed as number (for example, when 3 players meet, they are shown as 3).
=> Rules with 'blocking the field' and 'meeting on one field' are not implemented.
